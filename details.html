        <p><b>What is this app?</b></p>
        <p>This app helps you to know more about current affairs (in a nutshell).</p>
        <p><b>Seriously, what is this app?</b></p>
        <p>This app (TrendSetter) is a educational mobile app which aims to inform you about the latest and greatest issues our world is facing. We have developed this app as through our research we have found out that an important skill which would be valued in the workforce in the future is social awareness. Our app mainly comprises of articles about different current affairs issues and quizzes on these affairs. We have made this app mobile-friendly to appeal to our target audience, which are teenagers.</p>
        <p><b>Why do you need to create such an app?</b></p>
        <p>Firstly, this app is our submission for i.code 2017, a competition where teams comprising of three members develop an app which goes with the theme. Secondly, through our research, we have found out that teenagers nowadays need to be more aware of issues which the world faces in order to cope with the progressing and ever-changing world we live in. We believe that through this app we would entice teenagers to be interested in current affairs.</p>
        <p><b>What articles do you have?</b></p>
        <p>We have numerous articles based around the group it affects - local, regional and global. They range from conflicts in the Middle East to elections in the United Sates, so you can expect anything under the sun. However, do note that we are unable to cover every issue (our articles are written by people, not computer-generated).</p>
        <p><b>I want to view these articles on my computer, not my phone.</b></p>
        <p>Sure thing, just head to https://pipix51.github.io/TrendSetter/ (that should do the trick)</p>
        <p><b>How do I contribute an article?</b></p>
        <p>Send an email to the developers (email is shown below); either one should do the trick. We would review the article (we would not reject it unless it goes against our interests or is full of vulgarities) and publish it within a few working days (and we'll credit the article with your name - tell us if you do not want to do so).</p>
