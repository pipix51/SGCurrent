            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">The Nature Of Oil</h3>
            <p>Oil [1], or more often referred to as 'liquid gold', could be said to be the main entity which has propelled us into the Modern Era. This energy source was discovered only recently in the 19th century (1847 to be exact by the chemist James Young) and harnessed through a variety of technologies and proceedures, such as oil drilling, crude oil reservoir detection and fractional distillation. This 'liquid gold' is literally, the key driver in many of the machines that power our world, from transportation machines such as cars, buses and trains to those in the agricultural industry such as mills and harvesters. Many countries burn oil in order to generate electricity - oil, coal and natural gas are the main three fossil fuels which turn generators to produce electricity. </p>
			<p>Indirectly, oil has gained a foothold into areas beyond the economic arena and the free market, playing a big part in politics and society. Politicians, especially corrupt ones seeking favours or bribes, would make decisions to appease the executives of oil companies, such as supporting oil companies in land disputes against other interest groups such as indigenous people or nearby residents. The Organisation Of Petroleum Exporting Countries [2], or OPEC for short, has been known to manipulate oil prices in order to push their agendas through.</p>
            <p>Oil and its relative price can also affect the economy as well. When prices of oil are driven up, the cost of purchasing power or electricity in order to power machines would increase drastically, thereby hampering the lives of ordinary people as the prices of their daily essentials such as cosmetics and plastics (which are made using petroleum) go through the roof; this may lead to an economic slowdown if it continues for a long period of time. During such a period, non-oil exporting countries would have a harder time as compared to oil-exporting countries as more money would flow into the coffers of oil-exporting countries (through taxes by oil companies or government-owned oil companies) as compared to the non-oil countries.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, when prices of oil are driven down, the cost of purchasing electricity and petrol would experience a decrease, allowing citizens to live better lives as the prices oftheir daily essentials which require petroleum would also decrease, reflecting the price decrease of oil. However, for oil-exporting countries who have invested much money into programs which require constant funding, such as welfare (in the form of pensions) and infrastructure, a sharp decrease in oil prices could be life-threatening as the consistent, abundant supply of money from oil is now gone due to the decreased prices.</p>
			<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">The Standard Of Oil</h3>
			<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Standard_oil_octopus_loc_color.jpg" alt="Standard Oil cartoon" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; margin-bottom:5%; object-fit: contain">
			<p><i>Standard Oil held a fearsome monopoly on oil in the early 20th Century (Photo From Wikimedia Commons)</i></p>
            <p>In the late 19th Century to the early to mid 20th Century, oil has played a key part in society, fuelling (literally) humanity's drive into the modern era. However, as a result, some people distrust oil and associated energy resource companies. This is in part due to the (now-defunct) company Standard Oil [3]. During the 1890s and up til the 1910s, Standard Oil was an oil monopoly which was owned by John D. Rockefeller. It captialised on the oil boom in the United States, using aggressive tactics to push out its competitors through artificially deflating its prices (in the form of rebates and discounts). This turned the Rockefeller family into one of the most richest families into the world.</p>
			<p>However, the actions of Standard Oil soon drew the ire of lawmakers in the United States government. Politicians feared that by establishing a monopoly for oil in the country, Standard Oil could bend lawmakers to their will just by changing the price of oil to suit their needs, effectively holding them hostage with oil. Oil (in the form of kerosene) powered the railroads, which was the main form of long-range transport and cargo shipping then, as well as the lights which illuminated streets and houses. Antitrust investigators soon ordered Standard Oil to split up into 34 smaller companies, thereby breaking the monopoly held by the original company.</p>
			<p>Even though the era of Standard Oil has long past, a new term has emerged - "Big Oil" [4]. "Big Oil" refers to the world's biggest oil companies, namely British Petroleum (BP), Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Total and Eni, who account for much of the oil produced which is not owned by any government. These oil companies have merged together, reducing competiton and leveraging on economies of scale, thereby reducing oil prices for everyday consumers. However this does come at a potential cost of a monopoly forming. <b>Food For Thought: Do you think the oil companies should remain as is, or should they be further broken up to prevent a situation similar to Standard Oil?</b></p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">The Consequences Of Oil</h3>

            <p>Many countries around the world, especially the countries in the Middle East such as Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, rely on petroldollars to keep their economy up and running. Saudi Arabia, for example, is one of the richest countries in the world due to its large natural oil reserves; the government-owned oil company Saudi Aramco has a net revenue of US$478 billion, making it the largest oil company by revenue. As a result, Saudi Arabia has been able to finance the construction of infrastructure and the building of a military force to defend itself against its neighbouring hostile countries.</p>
			<p>Some countries who have large oil reserves may mismanage their finances, with corrupt governments fuelled by the greed of politicians. Take for instance Venezuela [5], the country with the largest known oil reserves in the world; oil was discovered in the 1900s and helped to power the growth of the economy of the country, this oil boom soon helped Venezuela to become one of the most urbanised countries in Latin America. However, due to the mismanagement of the petrodollars obtained from the oil reserves, Venezuela soon fell into disarray with a host of problems plauging it; this ranged from hyperinflation to poverty to unemployment and crime.</p>
			<p>Last of all, oil has even sparked wars. An example to illustrate this would be the Iraq War [6] which occured in 2003. Being the country with the second largest reserves of oil in the world, Iraq was a threat which could destablise the hegemony of America (Pax Americana). As a result, it was one of the leading factors (coupled with an increasingly hawkish administration and the terror attacks on September 11 2001 by Al-Qaeda, a terrorist group partially financed by the Iraq government) which propelled the United States of America to declare war on Iraq and topple the regime of Saddam Hussein.</p>
			<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">The Future Of Oil</h3>
			<p>Just like gold, our oil 'liquid gold' is an asset which could bring incredible wealth, prestige and power to the owner (in this case the country which owns it). However, oil itself comes with its own set of challenges. It can grant too much power; it can also cause greed and envy to surface, bringing about devastating consequences. With other alternative forms of energy such as solar energy, wind energy and geothermal energy coming into the spotlight and replacing oil as the main form of energy production, maybe we could see oil disappearing in the future. But in the meantime, oil is here to stay.</p>
