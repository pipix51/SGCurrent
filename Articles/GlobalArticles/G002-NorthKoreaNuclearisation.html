              North Korea's Nuclear Ambitions
            </div>
            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">Introduction To The Situation</h3>
            <p>North Korea, otherwise known as the Hermit Kingdom, sitting in the Korean Peninsula bordered by China to its north and South Korea to its south (logically)[1], has been known throughout the international community as an oddity. Officially called the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with an estimated population of about 24 million, she has been harbouring hopes of developing a nuclear bomb and thereby becoming the next country in the world to have weapons of mass destruction. These hopes have been for the longest time been pushed by the Kim dynasty (consisting of Kim il-Sung, Kim Jong-il and Kim Jong-Un) who have reigned as dictators ever since the Korean War in the 1950s and believe that with the possession of a nuclear arsenal they would be protected from their not-so-friendly neighbours South Korea and the all-mighty United States Of America. The developed nuclear bombs would safeguard the existence of North Korea (and possibly the Kim dynasty too).[2]</p>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/North_Korea-Pyongyang-Arirang_Mass_Games-03.jpg" alt="Loyalty In North Korea" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; margin-bottom:5%; object-fit: contain">
            <p><i>The government of North Korea demads absolute loyalty from its citizens (From Wikimedia Commons)</i></p>
            <p>However this comes at an obvious cost. In the pursuit of adding nuclear capabilities, North Korea has seemed to forgotten the essentials. The economy of North Korea is weak and brittle due to small internal demand and the government's stubborn unwillingness to open it its borders for trade with other countries (except China). The government's spending on the military sector is severly out of proportion, decreasing the already little natural and human resources possessed by the country. Men at the prime ages of 20 to 25 years old are drafted into the military from 5 years to up to 10 years. [3][4] Moreover, the North Korean state government controls all the media, ranging from radio stations to televisions and even newspapers; the nearly-absent  North Korean-controlled Internet can only be accessed through computers approved by North Korea, preloaded with mandatory North Korean opearting systems. As a result, many of the North Koreans live in poverty and oppression.</p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">Mutually Assured Destruction</h3> 
            <p>North Korea's erratic behaviour may seem as hilarious antics by many members of the international community, however to North Korea's neighbours and the world superpowers (namely the South Korea, United States, Japan and China), every unexpected move North Korea makes incites much worry.</p>
            <p>Tensions which were inflammed during the Korean War from 1950 to 1953 have still not been resolved between North and South Korea; technically there has not been any peace treaty signed and thus they are still at war. The Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) along the 38th Parallel which separates North and South Korea is one of the most heavily fortified and armed borders along the world, with many soldiers and guards stationed at each side. North Korea possesses one of the largest armies in the world consisting of 1 million members while South Korea possesses 560000 active personnel with approximately 3.5 million civil defence corps members; it is evident that both sides can inflict huge damage on each other if they choose to attack (estimates suggest that in the worst-case scenario if war breaks out between the two Koreas the death toll in greater Seoul, the capital of South Korea, could reach 130000). North Korea's erratic actions and its relentless pursuit for nuclearisation has caused much fear among South Koreans (especially the older South Koreans who remember the atrocities of the Korean War and the damage inflicted). [5][6]</p>

            <p><i>North Korea is bounded by China to the north and shares the Korean Peninsula with South Korea; Japan is located to its south and west. (From Wikimedia Commons)</i></p>
            <p>The United States of America has also been embroiled in the crisis of North Korea and its ambitions for nuclear weapons. As an ally of South Korea during the Korean War and the world superpower which possesses the most nuclear weapons, it has been frequently targeted by North Korea and portrayed as the villian by most North Korean media along with South Korea. This may partially be due to America's aggressive foreign policy to keep countries (with the agenda of remaining as the world's hegemon and continuing Pax Americana) which seeks to control North Korea through the imposing of trade sanctions. If a war breaks out between North Korea nd South Korea, America would be one of the first to respond through sending nuclear missiles (forming one of the main motivations of North Korea to develop nuclear capabillities).</p>
			<p>Unlike North Korea and the United States of America, Japan is relatively muted when it comes to military capabilities. This is in part due to the pacifistic nature and attitude adopted by most Japanese and the Japanese government afer World War 2, with the government then signing a treaty with the United States to promise not to develop a military force with the ability to attack other countries. However with the advent of regional threats ever since the Korean War, Japan has begun developing its own defensive military force called the JSDF or Japan Self-Defence Force in order to protect herself against external threats. Further development of a nuclear arsenal by North Korea can become the straw that breaks the camel's back when it comes to Japan's development of nuclear weapons; after all most of the Japanese who have witnessed first-hand the destruction inflicted by the atomic bombs dropped in World War 2 have passed on and the Japanese government is leaning more and more towards the right. [7]</p>
			<p>China, a once-vulnerable state which was subject to much bullying during the world wars, has in the 21st Century grown to be a formidable force which threatens the supremacy of the United States. Unlike the United States, China's foreign policy is not as aggressive; Chinese officials seek the cooperation and support of other countries when it comes to matters on the international arena and in exchange these other countries receive Chinese investments and tourists. This helps to explain why China still maintains trade with North Korea; North Korea would not risk a battle with China no matter the situation due to the sheer number of Chinese. China, however fears that if an invasion of North Korea were to take place regardless of the use of nuclear weapons, millions of North Korean refugees would move across the Yalu River which separates China and North Korea and flood into the northern parts of China, resulting in an unwanted humanitarian crisis which China has to deal with. China's wish to maintain the status quo in North Korea to prevent the above situation from realising is evident-it does not care much about North Korea's dictatorship, development of a nuclear arsenal and poor human rights records. Furthermore,China rarely does echo the calls of other countries in enforcing trade sanctions against North Korea.[8]</p>
            <p>All in all, tensions are fraught and could be said to be at a high in the Korean Peninsula mainly due to North Koreas continued ambitions to possess nuclear weapons. The nuclearisation of North Korea may also lead its surrounding countries to also develop nuclear capabilites, encouraging nuclear proliferation-one wrong move by any country may lead to many nuclear bombs launched and the mutually assured destruction of mankind. However, cooperation between the United States and China could halt this ambition. As for now, we can only wait and see.</p>
