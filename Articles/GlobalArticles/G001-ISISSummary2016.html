              A Summary OF ISIS In 2016
            </div>
            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">ISIS And Its Rise</h3>
            <p>2016 seemed to be the year which terror attacks became common. Bombings and kidnappings changed to become the norm in many different countries throughout the world, sparking a wave of fear among civilians, partially leading to the more enclosed and protectionist state of the world we currently live in now as of 2017. This drastic change could be mostly accounted for by one rogue faction - ISIL, or the The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; otherwise popularly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Being thrust into the spotlight after their capture of Mosul, Iraq in June 2014, ISIS has been a prominent force in Middle East, with a military comparable to that of neighbouring Arab countries. In the eyes of major countries and organisations such as the United Nations (UN), ISIS is seen as a terrorist organisation due to its imposing of harsh Islamic rule, or sharia, in the areas which they take control of, as well as the destruction of artefacts and monuments which have cultural and social importance.</p>
            <p>Members of ISIS see themselves as warriors who are fighting for an Islamic caliphate and follow an extremist interpretation of Islam, promoting religion-motivated violence as well as regarding other Muslims who do not agree with their extremist interpretation of Islam as traitors. ISIS soldiers rely on both conventional as well as non-conventional methods of warfare, and have an arsenal of weapons ranging from capture weapons found in Iraq as well as self-made improvised car bombs, IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and suicide bombers (which they have sent in numbers to other countries, causing harm to citizens living there). </p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">ISIS Activities In 2016</h3>
            <p>A report by The New York Times in July 2016 [1] found out that more than 1200 people have been killed by attacks which are inspired or coordinated by members of ISIS, in countries ranging from Australia and Canada to Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh and Yemen. There have been several terrorist bombings conducted by ISIS members who have killed and wounded civilians; examples which would be explored below include the Jakarta explosions in January 2016, bombings of Brussels, Belgium in March 2016, grenade attack in Malaysia in June 2016 and the Bastille Day attack in Nice, France on July 2017.</p>
            <p>In January 2016 [2][3], ISIS claimed that it was responsible for an attack in the centre of Jakarta, the capital and most-populated city in Indonesia. Explosions were set up in a suicide attack near a Starbucks shop, killing at least 7 people (inclusive of the 5 attackers) and wounding at least 23 people. Indonesia has been a country which has a Muslim majority and attracts many soldiers who wish to be a part of ISIS and the attack on Jakarta had set a precedent for a greater influence of ISIS over Southeast Asia.</p>
            <p>Bombings occured in Brussels [4][5], one of the major cities of Belgium in March 2016; it comprised of two terrorist attacks in Brussels Airport and one in the metro system of Brussels, at Maalbeek metro station. As the bombings took place in a densely-populated region, 32 civiians and 3 perpetrators were killed and close to 300 people were wounded in the blast. The terrorist attacks can be attributed to the fact that Belgium is a country which actively participates in efforts to counter ISIS, hence it is likely that ISIS has designated it as a target. Moreover, Brussels possesses districts where influences of ISIS exist.</p>
			<p>In June 2016, a live grenade was lobbed into a nightclub at Puchong, Malaysia [6][7]. Although the attack which injured 8 people, was initially thought to be an act on revenge by other businesses, it soon turned out that the attack was caused by an ISIS sympathiser who wanted to seek vengeance for the club operating during the holy period of Ramadan (which prohibits Muslims from engaging in such social activities). The attack was an important point as it marked the first ISIS-linked terrorist attack in Malaysia (a Muslim-majority country). (However, this terrorist attack was not the first terrorist attack in Southeast Asia - that would be the attack on Jakarta in Jaunary 2016 as mentioned above).</p>
			<p>Perhaps one of the worst ISIS-linked terrorist attacks happened on 14 July 2016, Bastille Day. [8] An ISIS sympathiser, 	Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, rented a truck and drove it down the Promenade des Anglais, a street closed to traffic and converted into a pedestrian zone in order to allow tourists and locals to view the Bastille Day fireworks. As the truck moved down the street the attacker ensured that he stayed on the pathway, thereby knocking down and killing even more people; the attacker was finally shot dead by police; however he caused 87 deaths (including the attacker) and 434 casualities.</p>
            <p><strong>
            The editor feels that the rise of ISIS is a worrying trend and should be curbed as soon as possible; this goal can be achieved through the means of good governance and policies to ensure that minorities are able to assimilate into society (thereby preventing radicalistion by extremist forces) as well as cooperation between counter-terrorism agencies and police, along with improving the awareness of people towards suspicious characters. If citizens and government work together, the rise of ISIS and the severe ISIS attacks which we see in 2016 would be stopped in their tracks.
            </strong></p>
