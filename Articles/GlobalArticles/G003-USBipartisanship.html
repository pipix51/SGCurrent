            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">What Is Bipartisanship?</h3>
            <p>Bipartisanship-at first glance it seems like a complicated word with an obscure definition; probably condemmed to the hell of some unknown law or public policy book. However, with the recent presidential elections of 2016 in the United States (bringing about the presidency of Donald Trump), this word 'bipartisanship' has seemed to jump into the forefront of media. The two main parties of the United States, the Democrats and the Republicans have been mentioning this word with unusual regularity; both report that the other party refuses to cooperate with their party and lacks 'bipartisanship' and how this lack of 'bipartisanship' is hurting the United States as a whole.[1]</p>
			<p>In essence, 'bipartisanship' is just the cooperation between two (hence the prefix 'bi') political parties (hence the root word 'partisan') which usually occupy opposite ends of the political spectrum (else this term 'bipartisanship' would not have been thrust into the foray). Bipartisanship (or the lack thereof) is particularly prominent in the United States as unlike Singapore or China (where a single political party dominates the arena or is in theory communist), there are two political parties wielding significant power and have stark differences.[2]</p>
			<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">The Political Spectra</h3>
			<img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/7/6043/6262122778_997339a086_b.jpg" alt="Republican Party And Democratic Party" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; margin-bottom:5%; object-fit: contain">
			<p><i>The two main political parties in the United States are the Republican Party (represnted by the elephant) and the Democratic Party (represented by the horse). (Photo From Flickr)</i></p>
            <p>The Democrats which pursue a more liberal position in the political spectrum of the United States, believe in causes that are more people and society-oriented (in order to make society more efficient and the lives of people better). They campaign for causes such as welfare (supporting the poor and disenfranchised), affirmative action (benefits such as educational scholarships to those who belong in the minority such as African Americans), immigration and equal rights (especially when it comes to gender, race and religion). On the other hand, the Republicans pursue a more conservative position in the political spectrum, believing in causes that are more economically-oriented, such as tax breaks (to lessen the burden of income tax on middle and upper-class citizens), a laissez-faire (non-interfering) approach towards trade and the free market as a whole (allowing the economy to run its own course and major institutions such as banks to do what they want).[3]</p>
			<p>However, as per nature, such a system usually degrades into chaos. Both the Democrats and Republicans, seeking to achieve an advantage and push through their agendas without opposition, have attacked each other and portrayed the other party as their enemy. Using media to their advantage, through television (CNN is more inclined towards Democrats while Fox News is more inclined towards Republicans), newspapers (The Guardian is more inclined towards Democrats while The Wall Street Journal is more inclined towards Republicans), and now social media. Democrats have strongholds in states along the west coast and east coast of the United States, such as California and New York while Republicans have strongholds in the centre of the country, such as Texas. [4]</p>
			<p>Due to the aggresive and relentless tactics of both parties, voters in the middle (the centrists/pragmatists) are faced with a dilemma. If they vote for the Democrats due to their welfare (which in the case may particularly attract them as they have benefited from it) they might also bring about affirmative action (which they may oppose as it does not empower the minority but instead rewards them for just being of a particular race). However if they vote for the Republicans as the Republicans oppose affirmative action it might bring about a cut in their welfare and health programs (which they may have benefited from). Choosing between the two parties to these group of voters is like choosing between a rock and a hard place-this is in part due to the nature of the political system of the US.</p>

			<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/111th_US_Senate_class_photo.jpg" alt="The US Senate" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; margin-bottom:5%; object-fit: contain">
			<p><i>Voting to pass or reject a bill in the United States takes place in the Senate, with 100 senators voting for or against the bill. (Photo From Wikimedia Commons)</i></p>
            <p>The lack of bipartisanary in Senate has led to the resurgence of the term 'filibuster'[5], which refers to the blocking of a bill (a rule) to pass in the Senate (could be described as the equivalent of the House Of Lords of the United Kingdom [6] in the United States) by a political party which opposes the bill through its members delievering excessively long speeches to delay the passing. The act of filibustering has been used by Democrats and Republicans alike in order to delay the bill which the opposition party wants to pass (examples are how the Democrats filibustered the swearing in of Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court Justice in 2017 [7] and Republicans filibustered the passing of the Affordable Care Act or 'Obamacare' in 2009 [8]).</p>
			<p>Both political parties have used the filibusters they took on each other to show to their voters how the opposing political party is the 'enemy' who lacks bipartisanship and how their own political party takes the moral high ground. To an extent, filibustering is an act on the moral low ground as it decreases productivity and effectiveness of the government. They have also used the 'nuclear option' (which is a move by the main political party to reduce the number of votes needed to pass the bill from 60 which is a supermajority to 51 which is a simple majority) in order to resolve filibusters by the opposition. [9]</p>
			<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">The Solution?</h3>
			<p>Honestly, there is no one true panacea for this manifold problem. The clear divide between political parties has already existed since the start of the American Civil War of 1865 and with the current political strategies and approaches the Democrats and Republicans take with regards to cooperation with each other (which is practically non-existent) it is highly unlikely that the political wounds inflicted would recover anytime soon. To heal a wound which has already existed sice the last century is a near-insurmountable feat that would only be accomplished through an educated workforce and an acceptance by members of both political parties that sometimes there is no correct approach to a particular problem.</p>
