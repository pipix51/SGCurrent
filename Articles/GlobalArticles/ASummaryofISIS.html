              Should Singaporean Teenagers Become Socially Aware?

            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">ISIS And Its Rise</h3>
            <p>2016 seemed to be the year which terror attacks became common. Bombings and kidnappings changed to become the norm in many different countries throughout the world, sparking a wave of fear among civilians, partially leading to the more enclosed and protectionist state of the world we currently live in now as of 2017. This drastic change could be mostly accounted for by one rogue faction - ISIL, or the The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; otherwise popularly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Being thrust into the spotlight after their capture of Mosul, Iraq in June 2014, ISIS has been a prominent force in Middle East, with a military comparable to that of neighbouring Arab countries. In the eyes of major countries and organisations such as the United Nations (UN), ISIS is seen as a terrorist organisation due to its imposing of harsh Islamic rule, or sharia, in the areas which they take control of, as well as the destruction of artefacts and monuments which have cultural and social importance.</p>
            <p>Members of ISIS see themselves as warriors who are fighting for an Islamic caliphate and follow an extremist interpretation of Islam, promoting religion-motivated violence as well as regarding other Muslims who do not agree with their extremist interpretation of Islam as traitors. ISIS soldiers rely on both conventional as well as non-conventional methods of warfare, and have an arsenal of weapons ranging from capture weapons found in Iraq as well as self-made improvised car bombs, IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and suicide bombers (which they have sent in numbers to other countries, causing harm to citizens living there). </p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">ISIS Activities In 2016</h3>
            <p>A report by The New York Times in July 2016 [1] found out that more than 1200 people have been killed by attacks which are inspired or coordinated by members of ISIS, in countries ranging from Australia and Canada to Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh and Yemen. There have been several terrorist bombings conducted by ISIS members who have killed and wounded civilians; examples which would be explored below include the Jakarta explosions in January 2016, bombings of Brussels, Belgium in March 2016, grenade attack in Malaysia and suicide bombings in Istanbul, Turkey in June 2016 and the Bastille Day attack in Nice, France on July 2017.</p>
            <p>In January 2016, ISIS claimed that it was responsible for an attack in the centre of Jakarta, the capital and most-populated city in Indonesia. Explosions were set up in a suicide attack near a Starbucks shop, killing at least 7 people (inclusive of the 5 attackers) and wounding at least 23 people. Indonesia has been a country which has a Muslim majority and attracts many soldiers who wish to be a part of ISIS and the attack on Jakarta had set a precedent for a greater influence of ISIS over Southeast Asia.</p>
            <p>Bombings occured in Brussels, one of the major cities of Belgium.</p>

                  The editor agrees with the article. More should be done to raise social awareness in Singapore, given the fact that its presence has numerous benefits. Replacing the apathy of current Singaporean teenagers with social awareness is not a task which should be left to the government and educators only; parents should also make teenagers aware of the problems and solutions to issues prevalent in society instead of sheltering their dearest sons and daughters.
            </strong></p>
