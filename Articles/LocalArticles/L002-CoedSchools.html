            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">Introduction To Co-ed Schools</h3>
            <p>Co-educational schools, abbreviated form co-ed schools. This term may sound unfamiliar to you and you may presume it is some soft of government jargon, however chances are that if you are a Singaporean citizen, it is likely that you have come across or even experienced co-education first-hand. This term 'co-ed schools' simply mean schools that have a mix of male students as well as female students. Co-educational schools make up the majority of Singapore primary schools, with 10 boys schools (5.18%), 21 girls schools (10.9%) and a staggering 162 co-educational schools (83.9%). Why are there so many co-educational schools? What are the benefits when it comes to education that co-educational schools offer in comparison to single-sex schools?</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">Co-ed Schools-Realistically Speaking</h3>
            <p>From a logical perspective, co-educational schools do not offer much when it comes to academics, considering that the curriculum taught in most schools follows the Ministry Of Education's guidelines. However, co-educational schools give children the chance the develop mentally, to become better-functioning citizens of soceity when it comes to interactions with the opposite gender. Imagine a hypothetical scenario - a boy and a girl are placed together in a co-ed school. What will they gain as compared to a single-sex school where a boy sits with another boy or a girl sits with another girl. It is highly likely that the boy and the girl in the co-educational school would not only have the chance to work with the opposite gender during school lessons and thereby developing social skills which would be extremely useful and applicable in the modern society; moreover the boy would be able to shed any gender sterotypes pertaining to the girl (and the opposite gender) and vice versa.</p>
            <p>In contrast, a single-sex school only allows for communication between students of the same gender. This may decrease their knowledge of social skills when they go on to higher education or even work; furthermore this closeted approach may cause them to reinforce each others' gender sterotypes due to the lack of exposure to the opposite gender. This may cause them to engage in activities which may contravene the rights and privacy of the other gender in the future or even worse, become a victim to these activities. As can be observed from this hypohetical scenario, co-ed schools allow for a safe and secure exposure to the opposite gender and allow them to inegrate into society better; hence this could explain the abundance of co-ed primary schools in Singapore</p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">Does The Trend Continue?</h3>
            <p>The prefernce for building co-ed schools continues into the secondary school phase, with 8 boys schools (4.76%), 16 girls schools (9.52%) and an overwhelming 144 co-educational secondary schools (85.7%). It seems then that co-educational schools clearly have an advantage over single-sex schools with more schools including both genders compared to schools which only accept one gender (in fact co-ed schools outnumber single-sex schools by 6 to 1).</p>
            <p>However, as the saying goes, facts do lie. The above figures only show that there is a overwhelming number of co-educational schools in contrast to the number of single-sex schools; they are not much of an indicator of the performance of co-educational schools whem compared to the number of single-sex schools. To illustrate this stand, take the schools which offer the Integrated Programme, or IP for short (which allows for high-performing students to skip the taking of the GCSE O'Level Examinations and complete a six-year course with only the GCSE A'Level Examinations at the end of their education). 5 out of 10 of the Integrated Programme schools orignated from a single-sex schools. The exemplary performance of schools with single-sex education when contrasted with thier low percentage as compared to single-sex schools is an indicator.</p>

			<p><i>What could explain the trend of single-sex secondary schools faring better than co-ed schools as mentioned above? (From Clker)</i></p>
            <p>The data and statements above do show that although it might not be the cae for single-sex primary schools, single-sex secondary schools are better than their co-educational counterparts. What could be the underlying reason to explain for this unusual trend? It has been suggested that single-sex schools do offer an advantage in that the students in single-sex secondary schools have the maturity which may not been found in primary schools and see their peers as goals and role models which they can relate to (being of the same gender) and become more motivated to compete and excel. Another reason that has been suggested is that single-sex schools may have a better reputation (after all, considering how co-educational schools offer more advantages in social aspects, the remaining single-sex schools must be steeped in tradition and the students there must have good academic performance for the school to survive and thrive against the co-ed schools)</p>
            <p><strong>
                  The editor agrees with the article; however as he is from a co-educational secondary school his viewpoint may be biased. How do you feel about co-educational schools? Are they better than single-sex schools are vice versa (or even neither)? What are your experiences regarding your co-educational experience?
