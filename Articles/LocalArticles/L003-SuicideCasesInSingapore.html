			<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">What Is Suicide?</h3>
			<p>Suicide. Often been regarded as a taboo topic, especially in the past, it has been pushed to the forefront of society in the past few years. Generally regarding as the act of killing oneself by his or her own means (through various ways such as consuming poison, hanging or carbon monoxide poisoning), suicide and its corressponding rates are now used to judge a society and the standard of living in a country. As an indicator, suicide rates are odd - one might expect suicides to be higher in developing countries that developed countries (just like homicide, the intentional killing of someone else, which is highest in Brazil, a developing country); however the matter of fact is that suicide is a phenomenon prevalent in all countries regardless of society, economy or politics. Singapore has an average suicide rate of 8.6 out of 100000 people per year; this is lower than other countries such as Australia and Canada at 10.4 out of 100000 people, the United States Of America at 12.6 out of 100000 people, Japan and South Korea at 15.4 and 24.1 out of 100000 people. However, it should be the aim of a good government to reduce this to zero.<p>
			<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">Youth Suicide In Singapore</h3>
            		<p>Nowadays, there have been an increase in children and teens, age below 19, asking for help after considering suicide. Young people are vulnerable because they may not have the resources to deal with pain or conflict. Teenagers especially may find it even more difficult to talk about their struggles and express the pain they are feeling inside. They tend to hide their pain behind a facade, not knowing where, how or who they can approach for help. Some may try to cope on their own in ways that can be harmful to themselves. Sometimes, they may feel so overwhelmed by strong negative emotions, and feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, that they cannot see the bigger picture and are unable to think rationally.</p>

			<p>Family relationship issues are the most common reasons cited by those who sought help. Children and teens who face problems communicating with their parents may feel lonely and ostracised as they have no family members to share their joys and troubles; family relationship issues may also bring about child abuse which further hurts the child's outlook of life and his mental well-being. Academic-related stress is also a problem that is very prevalent due to large amounts of schoolwork that students may have these days coupled with the challenging curriculum and sometimes unrealistic expectations from parents. Children may be misguided by their parents' expectations as well as the surrounding environment, perceiving that the only way to make their parents happy and fit into the status quo in their class, getting along with their friends, is to score well for exams; when these students do not score well for exams they may not be able to cope with it.</p>
	   		<p>Teens also struggle with self-esteem and identity issues, including low self-worth, gender confusion and existential doubt. They are further burdened by peer pressure due to the fact that everyone is always being compared. Humans are social animals; the denial of companionship in the form of friends can damage one's mental wellness; he or she may start to perceive society to be against him and that he has no one to turn to, leading him or her to commit or attempt suicide in order to escape from the 'harsh' society.</p>
			<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">Counsellors On Suicide</h3>
			<p>With the increased use of social media, people in this age group also face additional social pressure, said Ms Vinti Mittal, 45, a counsellor at TenderAge Counselling. "Children are exposed to all kinds of undesirable and perilous material. Therefore, they learn inappropriate methods to deal with problems. Some even turn to websites that promote suicide", she states.</p>

			<p>Samaritans of Singapore(SOS), an organization that promotes suicide prevention, has set up its own research arm to further strengthen evidence-based practice to look into information and findings that can aid local suicide prevention and intervention work for the whole community. A spokeperson for the organisation says regarding suicide "[I]t is important that society removes the stigma around suicide, especially the assumption that suicide is 'selfish' or 'attention-seeking'. This way more children, as well as teenagers will actively seek for help when in need."</p>
			<p>The stance of the Singapore government as well as society can also be deemed as a factor which limits the suicide. Most prominent members of society in Singapore such as politicians, celebrities and sportsmen do not have a positive attitude towards suicide; instead most of them are against the notion of killing oneself; this trend puts pressure on people who want to commit suicide to think twice before commiting the act. Most members of the public do not condone suicide; many feel that life is by itself precious and should be cherished instead of wasted in the form of suicide. Ways to seek help are also prevalent and widely known. Methods of counselling such as Samaritans Of Singapore (SOS) are widely known among the Singapore public, in contrast people in other countries do not know how to seek help when it comes to their mental wellbeing.</p>
