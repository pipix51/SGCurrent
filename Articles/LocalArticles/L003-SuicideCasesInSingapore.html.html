              Suicide Cases in Singapore
            </div>
            <p>Nowadays, there have been an increase in children and teens, age below 19, asking for help after considering suicide. Young people are vulnerable because they may not have the resources to deal with pain or conflict. Teenagers especially may find it even more difficult to talk about their struggles and express the pain they are feeling inside. They tend to hide their pain behind a facade, not knowing where, how or who they can approach for help. Some may try to cope on their own in ways that can be harmful to themselves. Sometimes, they may feel so overwhelmed by strong negative emotions, and feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, that they cannot see the bigger picture and are unable to think rationally.</p>
			<p>Family relationship issues are the most common reasons cited by those who sought help. Academic-related stress is also a problem that is very prevalent due to large amounts of schoolwork that students may have these days coupled with the challenging curriculum and sometimes unrealistic expectations from parents.</p>
			<p>Teens also struggle with self-esteem and identity issues, including low self-worth, gender confusion and existential doubt. They are further burdened by peer pressure due to the fact that everyone is always being compared.</p>
			<p>With the increased use of social media, people in this age group also face additional social pressure, said Ms Vinti Mittal, 45, a counsellor at TenderAge Counselling.</p>
			<p>Children are exposed to all kinds of undesirable and perilous material. Therefore, they learn inappropriate methods to deal with problems. Some even turn to websites that promote suicide.</p>
			<p>Samaritans of Singapore(SOS), an organization that promotes suicide prevention, has set up its own research arm to further strengthen evidence-based practice to look into information and findings that can aid local suicide prevention and intervention work for the whole community".</p>
			<p>It is important that society removes the stigma around suicide, especially the assumption that suicide is 'selfish' or 'attention-seeking'. This way more children, as well as teenagers will actively seek for help when in need.</p>
