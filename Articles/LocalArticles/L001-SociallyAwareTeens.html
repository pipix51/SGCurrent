              Should Singaporean Teenagers Become Socially Aware?
            </div>
            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">An Introduction - Social Awareness</h3>
            <p>So what is social awareness? Social awareness, as defined by sources such as Wikipedia, refers to the consciousness which is shared by people within a society or community.[1] To summarise, social awareness is the state to of being aware of the problems which plague the society or community. Examples of being socially aware is to understand the problems which are present in (for this case, Singapore) society, such as the mistreatment and prejudice against the elderly, physically disabled and mentally disabled; the state of the environment and land usage; the lack of motivation by young adults to start a family and have children; as well as the competitive education system.</p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">The Benefits Of Social Awareness
            <p>How can social awareness positively impact us all? One impact of social awareness is that it would enable us to develop emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence, otherwise known as emotional quotient (EQ), is the lesser-known counterpart to normal intelligence. Emotional intelligence enables people to have a deeper understanding of the issues which impact a society and the various aspects of such issues, such as the causes, effects, as well as long-term consequences that come with it. Individuals who possess emotional intelligence would have the ability to converse proficiently with other members of the society who are interested in such social issues.</p>
            <p>Moreover, individuals with emotional intelligence can contribute to the society and have positive effects on a community in the long run. People concerned with social issues can volunteer and donate to charities and causes which they feel are crucial to improving society, as well as advocate on issues and decisions by the government they approve or disapprove of. These individuals with social awareness can give decision-makers another viewpoint, especially from the minority, as well as inform them of possible effects and consequences which such decisions may bring about. </p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">Opinions Of Singapore Teenagers</h3>
            <p>Singaporean teenagers, when it comes to social awareness and voicing their opinions, are remarkably muted. Singaporean teenagers are not motivated to speak up, follow their causes and participate in events unless some renumeration is involved (be it academic grades or Values-In-Action hours). However, there exist a few who do not follow the status quo. During the debate about the Presidentâ€™s Address on May 2014, Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, stated the example of a socailly aware young adult, Nur Huzaima Binte Mahrom, who has tutored less privileged children in Singapore, helped build a community centre in Nicaragua, and worked with locals to run a social enterprise on the developing outskirts of Manila.[2] This is evidence of how Singaporean teenagers who possess social awareness can have such a positive impact on society.</p>
            <p>The Government of Singapore has also recognised the powerful and far-reaching benefits which socially aware teenagers can bring. A good example of this can be found in Youth Corps Singapore, which was founded by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth. The goal of Youth Corps Singapre, to quote from the official website [3], is to-</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.youthcorps.sg/"> Bringing together Singapore Citizens and PRs aged 16 to 35, Youth Corps Singapore provides a platform for youths to learn new skills and meet like-minded peers, who aspire to go forth and create a better Singapore and a better world for all.</blockquote>
            <p>To conclude, social awareness in teenagers is important in teenagers; Singaporean teenagers should have social awareness in order for society to benefit as a whole in the long term. Not only will social awareness increase the knowledge of the affected and underprivileged in our society, it will also increase the chances of actions being taken to ensure that all Singaporeans can begin on an equal footing, thus giving rise to a truly meritocratic society.</p>
            <p><strong>
                  The editor agrees with the article. More should be done to raise social awareness in Singapore, given the fact that its presence has numerous benefits. Replacing the apathy of current Singaporean teenagers with social awareness is not a task which should be left to the government and educators only; parents should also make teenagers aware of the problems and solutions to issues prevalent in society instead of sheltering their dearest sons and daughters.
            </strong></p>
