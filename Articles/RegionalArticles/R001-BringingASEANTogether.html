              How ASEAN Was Brought Together
            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">An Introduction - What is ASEAN?</h3>
            <p>What is ASEAN? ASEAN, The Association of Southeast Asian Nations is a regional group that promotes economic, political, and security cooperation among its ten members. Formed 50 years ago (as of the time of writing this article), ASEAN was formed by the visionary leaders of Southeast Asia in order to achieve the goals stated in the ASEAN Declaration, signed in Bangkok, Thailand on 8 Auguest 1967 - first, to accelerate economic growth in the region; second, to promote regional peace and stabiity; third, to promote active collarboration and cooperation among members in the ASEAN community; fourth, to provide assistance in fields such as education; and finally to promote Southeast Asian studies.[1][2]</p>

            <p>ASEAN consists of 10 states - Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Myanmar and Philippines - found exclusively in the Southeast Asian region. Despite being separated geographically through oceans and country borders, the Southeast Asian states are still held strongly together, their relationships survivng through thick and thin. However, now this bond is being threatened with radical changes in the region.</p>
            <p>The first and probably the most important threat to the stability to the region is the rise of China. China, a country which has in the past 20 years experienced phenomenal year-on-year growth, due to the strong domestic market and good governance by the officials, is investing much money into Southeast Asian countries, in particular the developing ones (due to the cheap labour and loose business laws and regulations). However China's rate of progress has been impeded in the aftermath of a number of global financial crisis, resulting in these countries receiving less and less Chinese investment, putting the developments and plans of local governments on hold.[3]</p>
	    <p>Another threat to the stability of the Southeast Asian region could be the rise of populism in the various countries which comprise ASEAN. For example, the current president of Philippines (as of the time of writing) is Mr Rodrigo Duterte, a firebrand who rose to prominence due to his harsh remarks towards drugs and his tough stance towards drug offenders and dealers; his tough stance won him many supporters from the general public, however he has also come under fire from international human rights groups who claim that his treatment of drug offenders is morally wrong. The current governor of Jakarta (as of the time of writing), Mr Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, better known as Ahok,has been pushed out of his governor position due to far-right populist firebrands accusing him of insulting the Muslim religion and the Quran during one of his speeches; this is surprsing as the Indonesian government is moderate and unlike some Middle East countries do not have a political arena that is particularly welcoming of extreme right-wing politicians.[4]</p>
	    <p>Furthermore, a third threat to the stability of Southeast Asia is the increasing number of internal conflicts within countries. The Rohingya crisis which faces Myammar is a notable illustration of this problem. The Rohingya people are an ethnic Muslim group living in Rakhine state, Myammar; they are persecuted and are treated with hositilty by many people in Myammar who feel that are refugees who have fled from neighbouring country Bangladesh. The main leader in Myammar, Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, does not openly acknowledge the presence of the Rohingya in Myammar, drawing the ire of other Muslim-majority countries in Southeast Asia and international human rights watchdogs.[5][6]</p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">Overcoming Changes</h3>
            <p>Clearly, in order for Southeast Asia and the various countries to cope and adapt to our ever-changing and transient world, improvements need to be done immediately to harmonise the various countries and work together to accomplish a common goal. This can be achieved through ASEAN. ASEAN Summits (the 30th ASEAN Summit concluded recently as of the time of publication) are vital in improving cooperation in the region, giving the leaders of countries a safe and secure platform for them to voice their opinions regarding issues which their own country faces as well as the global threats that affect the whole Southeast Asian region, such as provocations by North Korea, the ascent of China as well as radicalism and the growing influence of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the Middle East.</p>
            <p>Through ASEAN Summits, not only can the leaders of various countries in Southeast Asia have a face-to-face meeting, enhancing bilateral ties and transboundary cooperation, the economy of the countries can also receive boosts from trade pacts and  pledging investments from other countries. Developed countries can tap into the potential and labour which developing countries offer and developing countries can utilise the expertise and knowledge provided by the developed countries; ASEAN and its related summits are two-way streets which provide enormous benefits to all participating countries.[7]</p>
            <p>Finally, ASEAN provides opportunities for all, especially the youths of the various Southeast Asian countries. Teenagers who have an aptitude for learning and are good in their academic studies have the chance to go for immersions organised by ASEAN to other neighbouring Southeast Asian countries to learn more about the cultures of each country and to exchange knowledge and experience with students of other countries. Furthermore, some students can also receive scholarships by ASEAN which allow them to pursue their further education at other Southeast Asian countries, allowing these students to climb up the ladder os social mobility.</p>
            <p><strong>
              The editor believes that Southeast Asia is a rich a diverse region brimming with opportunites. ASEAN gives the various countries of Southeast Asia a great platform to tap into the opportunites that cooperation between Southeast Asian countries provide. Here's to the next 50 years of ASEAN!
            </strong></p>
