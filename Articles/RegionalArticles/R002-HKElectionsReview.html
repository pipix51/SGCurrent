              Hong Kong Elections:Looking Back
            </div>
            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">Summary</h3>
            <p>Elections in Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region under China, with a population of about 6 million, occured about 3 months ago (as of the time of writing) on 26 March 2017, with Ms Carrie Lam, the former Chief Secretary of Administration, being sworn in as the 5th Chief Executive of Hong Kong [1] (thereby also becoming the first female leader of Hong Kong). Looking back at the elections now, to an extent it is unsurprising that Ms Carrie Lam [2] has obtained the position as Chief Executive. However by analysing the events that lead up to the election as well as draw parallels between Hong Kong and other countries, we can gain a deeper understanding of Hong Kong and the social, political and economic problems that it faces.</p>
			<p>Hong Kong, located at the mouth of the prosperous Pearl River Delta in China, bordered by mainland China at the north and west and the Pacific Ocean towards the south and west, has always been seen by the global community as a successful city.[3] Having been established as a bustling trading colony since the days of colonisation (similar to Singapore), it has since transformed into a world-renowned financial hub. Hong Kong has capitalised the advent of China's economy, which began in the 1980s, putting its strategic location to good use by allowing international trade in its harbour, importing and exporting goods from mainland China (although this has diminished to an extent with other cities such as Shenzhen building their own harbours).</p>

			<p><i>Hong Kong is a bustling, densely-population city littered with skyscrapers. Due to its strategic location it is one of the most renowned financial hubs globally. (Photo from Wikimedia Commons)</i></p>
			<p>Due to its mountainous centre region, the people of Hong Kong live near the coast or other islands in the Hong Kong archipelago (specifically Hong Kong Island and Kowloon). Land is scarce as a result, with high property prices as well as an absurd number of skyscrapers; people who do not have much money are forced to live in small, rented, 'shoebox'-like apartments. The high population density also puts much stress on the local education system, as the locals of Hong Kong have to compete with each other for places in higher education institutes (these institutions only aceept about 60000 students in total). Income inequality in Hong Kong is high, with the Gini coefficient (a number which measures the income inequality of a particular place; the higher the coefficient the worser the income inequality) at 53.7, which is significantly higher than other developed countries; for comparison Singapore's Gini coefficient is 45.8.[4]</p>
			<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">The Contestants</h3>
            <p>The Hong Kong elections of 2017 started when the 4th Chief Executive, Mr Leung Chun-Ying [5], refused to contest for a second term, unlike his predeccesors whom all ran for a second term. The news was not surprising, as Mr Leung had come under fire from many Hong Kongers for not being able to solve the issues which plagued most of the locals in their lives, such as a stressful education and rising housing prices. Mr Leung, who had a pro-Beijing stance, also came into heavy conflict with the rising Hong Kong independence movement, culminating in the 'Umbrella Revolution' movement by pro-democracy activists.</p>
			<p>With Mr Leung's refusal to run for a second turn, Ms Carrie Lam as well as her main competitor, Mr John Tsang [6], who was the former Financial Secretary, resigned from their positions in the government in order to throw their hats into the ring. A retired judge, Mr Woo Kwok-Hing, also contested in the election for the next Chief Executive (he announced his contestion before the other two), making the election a three-way contest. At first, Mr John Tsang lead opinion polls for the genral elections, with pundits betting that he would win the next election due to his down-to-earth personality and humble background, which resonated with the local populace. On the other hand Ms Lam stumbled, with pro-democracy activtists feeling that she was similar to Mr Leung (considering that she was the second-in-charge during Mr Leung's administration as Chief Secretary Of Administration) and that her election as the next Chief Executive would bring about the same consequences as Mr Leung's tenure.</p>

			<p>As Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region under China (Hong Kong used to be a British colony which was handed over by the British in 1997), the governing system of both states have clashed. Hong Kong and its citizens favour a democratic system (the power to elect a leader lies with the people) whereas China is a communist state (there is only one party, who elects a leader among themselves without the peoples' influence). Under the 1997 handover agreeement of Hong Kong, Hong Kong is governed by China under the 'one country, two systems' policy [7], where Hong Kong is allowed to govern its own political and economic realms without interference from China. However, the fact that most of the elected members and Chief Executives have been favoured and approved by Beijing (China) has angered many pro-democratic individuals whom feel that China should stay of out Hong Kong's political affairs.</p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">Election Results</h3> 
            <p>Despite Mr John Tsang's wide popularity among the local Hong Kong population, he was seen as less favoured by the Chinese officials as compared by Ms Carrie Lam, with his resignation from office taking one month to approve by the Chinese government as compared to Ms Carrie Lam, who only took one week to get her resignation approved. Ms Lam's popularity also surged when many moderate Hong Kongers supported as she was able to negotiate successfully with protestors during the Occupy Central movement in 2013. Many centrists and pro-Beijing supporters felt that if Ms Lam was elected she would deal with dissidents and protestors efficiently and minimise the impact of such activists and movements on the economy and society. (Mr Woo Kwok-Hing stayed relatively out of the spotlight with regards to the election).</p>

			<p><i>Although Mr John Tsang consistently had a polling result more than Ms Carrie Lam, he eventually lost the election due to a lack of support from pro-Beijing Election Committee members. (Photo From Wikimedia Commons)</i></p>
			<p>Similar to the United States, Chief Executives of Hong Kong are elected to office by an electoral college, called the Election Committee [8]; it comprises of 1200 members as of the 2017 election and the majority of members have a pro-Beijing stance. Ms Carrie Lam was elected into office as the 5th Chief Executive with 777 votes (68.81%), with Mr John Tsang receiving 365 votes (31.38%) and Mr Woo Kwok-Hing receiving 21 votes (1.81%).</p>
            <p>Unlike elections in other countries, there is a noticeable lack of ad hominem (attacks of the person, in this case the politicians) speeches made by the contestants. The candidates who threw their hats into the ring do not have a certain stance on the political spectrum; they are neither liberal nor conservative, instead they are pragmatic, making the best decisions regardless of public opinion. This may be due to the fact that Hong Kong is an economic hub and only an economic hub; unlike other countries which can survive on populist policies such as the United States, Hong Kong has only one egg in its basket (although a big one)-finance; hence it would be in the country's best interest to elect a leader which would make the best decisions to ensure Hong Kong's sustainability and survivalbility in the long run.</p>
            <p>The media have also remained relatively muted with regards to the election; most media outlets are non-partisan (do not have a specific stance on the political spectrum). The amount of radical left-wing and right-wing parties are also virtually absent in the political election (this may be in part due to high literacy rates among the populace, who are rational enough to figure out the benefits and failings of particular policies).</p>
			<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">What's Next</h3>
			<p>Ms Lam would take office on 1 July 2017. Despite her landslide victory in the Election Committee, she faces an uphill task-pleasing the local population. With burgeoning Chinese investment (driving up property prices), rising hatred among locals for the mainland Chinese and the Beijing government, as well as the growing pro-independence and pro-democracy movements, Ms Lam has many problems to tackle in her 5-year tenure as Chief Executive until 2022. With her pro-Beijing stance similar to her predeccesor, the author feels that Hong Kongers should not expect much from her when it comes to political reform (it should remain the status quo); instead they should focus on her efforts to combat prevalent social issues and deal with the impact of the bearish world economy on Hong Kong.</p>
