              One Belt One Road
            </div>
            <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">An Introduction: One Belt One Road</h3>
            <p>'One Belt One Road'. This phrase has been popping out in the local newspapers and has become an issue of interest when it comes to Asian affairs with increasing regularity. So what exactly is this 'One Belt, One Road' scheme? [1] One Belt, One Road, more appropriately known as the Belt and Road Initiative, is a proposal put out by China, the largest country in Asia in terms of population, to increase trade with other countries in Asia which it is in close proximity to, such as India, Russia and even Malaysia. This would be carried out through establishing close bilateral ties with these nations, providing necessary investment with regards to infrastructure on these trade routes.</p>
			<p>The name 'One Belt, One Road' refers to two routes - the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Maritime Silk Road. This name harks back to the ancient Silk Road, a path which connects European traders to the Chinese mainland (made famous by Marco Polo), allowing for traders of both regions to trade rare and exotic goods (Eurpoean travellers used to bring back silk from China back to Europe, hence the name). The Silk Road Economic Belt stretches into the heart of China, towards the west and runs through Central Asia, before reaching the end, at Turkey.</p>
            <p>In contrast, the Maritime Silk Road is not a 'road' specifically, it is also another trade route which connects China to other countries. The Maritime Silk Road runs down the Chinese coast, before entering into Southeast Asia and its constituent countries such as Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore, before heading into East Asia and coming into contact with countries such as Sri Lanka, India, then finally ending in East Africa. Singapore, as a regional and renowned hub for trading and finance in the Asian region, is comfortably poised to profit from this One Belt, One Road initiative [2]. However, there exist major problems which stand in the way.

			<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">Relationships: China and Singapore</h3>
            <p>China and Singapore's relationship was smooth at the beginning. In the past centuries, people from China emigrated from their homelands to seek a living in the booming trading port of Singapore, bringing along their language and culture. Now, the majority of Singaporeans are Chinese and have a good grasp of the Chinese language (due to bilinugalism and related policies enacted by the government). After the reformative years since China's independence, in the 1980s the then Chinese Premier Deng Xiaoping saw that by opening China up to foreign trade, its citizens would prosper. He visited Singapore and modelled China's economy and manufacturing on Singapore, opening China's ports to profitable foreign trade; in turn improving Singapore and China's relationship.</p>
			<p>Singapore and China have worked together on many issues, but mainly on finance and the economy. This cooperation is visible in the (Sino-Singapore) Tianjin Eco-City [3], where both Singapore and China cooperated in order to create a city which is sustainable and appealing for residents to live in. Singapore, having created a first-world country from a third-world one in less than 30 years, is a country which possesses many experts on city-building which China could leverage one. Furthermore, China is a frequent participant in ASEAN (Association Of Southeast Asian Nation) and has often sent important politicians and bureaucrats to these dialogues, voicing their opinions; this shows that China takes a strong interest in Southeast Asia.</p>

			<p>However, Singapore has always maintained a stance that balances both China and the world hegemon, the United States of America. By maintaining a netural relationship with both China and the United States and not favouring one or the other extremely when it comes to global issues, Singapore was able to gain the best of both worlds. However, if Singapore joined the One Belt, One Road initiative, people from other countries would perceive Singapore to be biased towards China; as a result Singapore may not be able to enjoy any investment offered by the United States.</p>

            <p>What About Other Countries?</p>

			<p>What about the other countries which have readily accepted China's One Belt, One Road initiative? The Philippines was a strong critic of China before One Belt One Road sprang into the limelight; it has complained about how Chinese-licenced fishing boats were intruding into the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the Philippines, disturbing the fisherman and the fishing industry of Philippines. The Philippines had claimed that China and its fishermen do not practice sustainable fish, fishing extremely large quantities of fish without ensuring this amount is replenished; and that sometimes the Chinese fishing vessels would be accompanied by the Chinese Coast Guard to intimidate local fishermen. The Philippines also argued that China's controversial 'nine-dash' line (a line of a map which extends into the South China Sea) was not a fair territorial claim. [4]</p>
            <p>The Philippines even brought this case up to the international tribunal for arbitration, however China announed that they would disregard the ruling (the tribunal ruled in favour of the Philippines). With increasing investments and inclusion into the One Belt, One Road from China into the Philippines, the Philippine government has softened its stance on China, establishing a Code Of Conduct with China and not mentioning the case in the global arena. As of the moment it seems that China's One Belt, One Road has placated the Philippines. [5]</p>
            <p>In contrast to the Philippines, Malaysia is having a better time dealing and cooperating with China. China has stepped in to Malaysia and stabilised its economy in 2014 and 2015 after Malaysia was hit by an oil crisis, buying Malaysian-government issued bonds to prop up the economy. More importantly, following the 1MDB (a Malaysian strategic development company related to the government) fallout, Chinese companies offered to buy up the loss-making subsidaries of the companies. However, by doing so it is obvious that Malaysia is becoming more and more reliant on China and its presence; its heavy reliance on China instead of itself makes its situation very vulnerable if China suddenly suffers a 'bout' of protectionism and pulls out of these countries. [6][7]</p>
			<h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-color:#333333">The Ideal Solution For Singapore?</h3>
			<p>Singapore, as always, should tread carefully when it comes to such situations. The 'One Belt, One Road' initiative is just another brick in the 'wall'  regarding the conflict between the current superpower (the United States Of America) and the emerging superpower (China). The Greek philosopher Thucydides once remarked that "What made war inevitable was the growth of Athenian power and the fear which this caused in Sparta.", referring to Sparta, the current superpower and Athens, the rising superpower. [8] If Singapore makes a hasty and unprepared decision when it comes to this issue, it may end up embroiled in the conflict between Athens and Sparta.</p>
