# SGCurrent

## Details
SGCurrent is an application developed by Y3 Dunman High School Infocomm Club (Junior High) (DHSJHICC).
This application is designed using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Angular 2(Material Design).
This application will be hosted on Github-Pages(gh-pages) and Heroku (currently planned as a backup server, may transition to become the main website hosting server if web traffic increases, scalable dynos). The aim of this application is to serve as a guide for (mainly) Singaporean teenagers regarding the issues in our ever-changing world. There would be articles, case studies and data sheets written, published and posted on the web application. 
In order to further engage our intended audience, we have decided to add a comments section so that interested users can share their views regarding articles they have views on. We (the developers) have also decided to encourage users to write articles about topics they would like to share about so that the community can be further improved.
