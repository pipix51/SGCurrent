# TrendSetter

## Details
TrendSetter is an application developed by Y3 Dunman High School Infocomm Club (Junior High) (DHSJHICC). This application is designed using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Angular 2(Material Design).

This application will be hosted on Github-Pages(gh-pages) and Heroku (currently planned as a backup server, may transition to become the main website hosting server if web traffic increases, scalable dynos). The aim of this application is to serve as a guide for (mainly) Singaporean teenagers regarding the issues in our ever-changing world. There would be articles, case studies and data sheets written, published and posted on the web application. 

In order to further engage our intended audience, we have decided to add a comments section so that interested users can share their views regarding articles they have views on. We (the developers) have also decided to encourage users to write articles about topics they would like to share about so that the community can be further improved.

## Functionalities
TrendSetter is a news application designed to keep its target audience of teenagers abrest about current affairs (thereby becoming a trendsetter, hence the name). TrendSetter would feature articles published by the developers as well as datasheets, thereby serving as a handy tool for Singaporean students in their language, humanities and social sciences subjects.

In TrendSetter, users can browse through the articles based on scope (local, regional and global). These scopes can be further divided into sections - one for popular articles, one for recent articles, and an index listing the articles in alphabetical order. Users who are interested in an article can comment on it and even submit another article (to counter or agree with the original article).

## Unique Functions
The first thing unique about TrendSetter is that it is the one and only site which offers teenagers who are socially aware a place to broaden their horizons and expound on topics and articles they are interested in. Unlike other news outlets which may cater to adults or only offer a recount of events which happen, articles in TrendSetter are mostly based on opinion and focuses on the Why, How and Consequences of an event (instead of aspects such as Who, What and When). This is a highly desirable quality which many people (such as interviewers) have indicated that they look out for in students.

Secondly, the design of the webpage has been planned so that it is intuitive to the users. By using Material Design to the fullest, students who are used to Google Suite would find using TrendSetter easy.
